1. Purpose and Scope

Goal: Deliver accessible, high-quality digital Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia (dCBT-i) in Taiwan.
Target Users: People in Taiwan suffering from insomnia.
Core Problem: Low accessibility to evidence-based insomnia therapies.

2. Functionality & Features

mainly online-only
MVP (First Launch)

Sleep Diary: Daily entries, sleep/wake time tracking, sleep quality rating.
Assessments: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), depression/anxiety screenings.
User Authentication: Secure login/sign-up via Firebase Auth.

Secondary Features (Post-MVP)

Educational Modules: CBT-i modules (sleep hygiene, stimulus control, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring).
Sleep Data Analysis: Automatic calculation and visualization of sleep metrics.
Push Notifications: Reminders for diary entries, assessments, educational content. (customizable)
Payments: Integration for subscription/premium access (available at MVP); Taiwanese customer friendly

3Ô∏è. Platforms & Technology

Platform: Flutter + Dart (latest Android & iOS versions).
Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore database, Cloud Messaging, Analytics, Functions).
Version Control: GitHub.
Development OS: Windows

4. UX/UI Design
Try to use Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, let's make something sleek, sexy, modern, and easy to use, with nice animations too if we can.
Really modern and sexy sleek minimal apple style MacOS style UI design, make it sexy, sleek. Animations, UI. Modern, amazing STEVE JOBS LEVEL lets GO! Always reaffirm to me that we are doing it using Apple Guidelines and how we used them in this design.

No prototype. Start from scratch using Apple's and Android's guidelines

Language: Traditional Chinese

5. Data & Backend

Remote data storage (Firestore).
Essential backend services:
Authentication (Firebase Auth): email/password
Database (Firestore)
Analytics (Firebase Analytics)
Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
Payments (Stripe via Firebase Extensions)

6. Development Approach

Waterfall Model:
Planning & Design
Implementation
Integration & Testing
Deployment
Maintenance (weekly updates)
GitHub for version control.
Potential CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Codemagic (help me )

7. Testing & QA

Preferred: Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
Automate testing (Flutter's integration_test package).
AI-Help Needed: Generate automated integration test scripts.

8. Deployment & Distribution

Review Apple App Store & Google Play Store guidelines ASAP.
Plan weekly updates post-launch.

9. Performance & Analytics

Firebase Analytics for user engagement.
Firebase Crashlytics and Performance Monitoring recommended.

10. Legal & Security

Comply with Taiwan PDPA.
Data Security: Firebase Security Rules, data encryption.
Privacy Policy and Terms of Service clearly presented in-app.

11. Maintenance & Support

Weekly updates post-launch.
Continuous customer feedback implementation via AI-driven coding.

12. Monetization

Subscription model with advertisements
Freemium (basic features are free, advanced features are paid)
